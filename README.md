### ReasonReact TodoApp

**Related Blog Post:** [Title](#)

This is an implementation / variant of Jared Forsyth's [tutorial on ReasonReact](https://jaredforsyth.com/2017/07/05/a-reason-react-tutorial/).

This implementation differs from the tutorial in a few ways.

1. It uses `create-react-app` with [reason-scripts](https://github.com/reasonml-community/reason-scripts)
2. It splits the code into different files (modules).
3. It implements shared state by using the `App` component as the _root_ component. This is discussed in detail on my [related blog post](#).
